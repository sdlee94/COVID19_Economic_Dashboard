## About the App

COVID-19 has transformed the economy in unprecedented ways. Through remote collaboration, my team and I produced an [**Interactive Dashboard**](https://stephenlee94.shinyapps.io/COVID19_Economic_Dashboard/) to track the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy. Currently, our dashboard provides insights into how the pandemic is affecting GDP, employment and the stock market, focusing on Canada and the United States.

COVID-19 related data is sourced from [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and updated on a daily basis.

Economic related data is sourced from the [US Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/), the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca). Economic data will be updated as new data becomes available.
