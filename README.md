## About the App

COVID-19 has transformed the economy in unprecedented ways. Through remote collaboration, my team and I produced an [**Interactive Dashboard**](https://stephenlee94.shinyapps.io/COVID19_Economic_Dashboard/) to track the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy. Currently, our dashboard provides top-level insights into how the pandemic has affected GDP, employment and the stock market, focusing on Canada and the United States.

COVID-19 related data was sourced from the [COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

Economic related data was sourced from the [US Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/), the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) and [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca).
